I want to thank everyone who helped me with various aspects of conducting this research. My special thanks go to my advisor, Dr. Mehdi Bagherzadeh, for helping me to pursue the research and for his guidance, patience, and support throughout this research. His insights and words of encouragement will always resonate in my life. I thank the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Research Office at Oakland University for supporting and recognizing our research. I wish to acknowledge the support and unyielding love of my family, my husband, Hari Kishan, my mother, Padmavathi, my in-laws, Rajendra Prasad, and Indira Krishna. I would also like to thank my classmate Andrew Walwema and my roommate Thanaa Ali Al-Khawaja for being a helpful research partner. They all kept me going on, and this work would not have been possible without their encouragement.
