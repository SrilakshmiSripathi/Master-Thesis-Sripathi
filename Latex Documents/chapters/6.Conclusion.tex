\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS}
We have discussed our large scale sentiment analysis in this thesis. In this final chapter, we present future work and conclusion.

\section{Conclusion}

We performed sentiment analysis on a large scale dataset with 400K Stackoverflow questions and answers belonging to concurrency and big data datasets in comparison to the related work. 

We found a strong inverse correlation between the popularity metric average favorites measure with the negative sentiment in both concurrency and big data datasets. Indicating that concurrency and big data software developers expressing less negative emotions tend to gain more likes from the users. Concurrency and big data correlations demonstrate that negative and neutral sentiment has some correlations with popularity and difficulty metrics. We also found that concurrency and big data developers are not sensitive towards positive sentiment, as we did not find correlations between positive sentiment with popular- ity and difficulty. We conclude that the software developer's sentiment towards a challeng- ing task has an impact on their productivity. 

\section{Future Works}
We plan to explore the sentiment of software practitioners developing different technologies like security, programming languages, and deep learning.
